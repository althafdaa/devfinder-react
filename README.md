## My Process

### Built with

- ReactJs (Component Based, State Management, React Hooks)
- Tailwind CSS
- DaisyUI
- React Router v6
- Axios

### What I Learned

I learned a lot about Tailwind and im having a lot of fun, even though the JSX/html become lot messier with all the utilities classes but the customization is really so easy and it doesnt look like any other web that use high-level framework like Bootstrap.

### Continued Development

Probably Dark/White Theme just like my previous project
